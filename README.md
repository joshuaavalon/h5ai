# h5ai

This is a fork of [h5ai][h5ai]. Since the maintainer stopped developing, this repository is meant to provide Docker support and add some features on top of it.

The public issue tracker is located at [GitHub][github] but the source code it hosted on [private GitLab server][gitlab].
GitHub source code will be a mirror and PR will be merge at GitLab instead.
